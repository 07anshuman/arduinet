# Arduinet: Multi-Microcontroller IoT Management

Arduinet is a C#-based framework designed to streamline the management and communication between multiple Arduino/ESP-based IoT devices. When working on projects involving multiple microcontrollers, interfacing them can be complex. Arduinet solves this challenge by providing a unified interface for device communication and interaction.

## Key Features

- ** Multi-Protocol Support**: Arduinet supports Serial, Bluetooth, and Wi-Fi (ESP8266/ESP32) communication protocols.
- ** Modular and Extensible Design**: Built with interfaces and dependency injection, allowing easy addition of new communication channels and devices.
- ** Centralized Device Management**: The framework manages the discovery, connection, and state maintenance of connected devices.
- ** Bidirectional Messaging System**: Facilitates smooth communication between the host application and microcontrollers.
- ** Interactive GUI**: A user-friendly interface for visualizing device output, sending commands, and monitoring the IoT system.

##  Architecture Overview

### 1. ** ArduinetServer**
   - Acts as the central hub, initializing and managing communication channels for connected Arduino devices.
   - Supports extensibility via the `IArduinetChannel` interface, enabling the addition of new protocols.

### 2. ** ArduinetDeviceManager**
   - Handles device discovery and management. 
   - Creates and manages instances of `ArduinetDevice` for each detected microcontroller.

### 3. ** Messaging System**
   - The `ArduinetMessage` class represents messages exchanged between the host and devices.
   - The `ArduinetMessageHandler` processes incoming messages and dispatches them to the appropriate event handlers.

### 4. ** GUI Application**
   - Provides a visual interface for interacting with devices, sending commands, and viewing output.
   - Decouples the presentation logic from the core framework, enabling easy customization of the interface.

##  Usage Workflow

1. ** Server Initialization**: Start by initializing the `ArduinetServer`, which sets up supported communication channels (Serial, Bluetooth, Wi-Fi).
2. ** Device Discovery**: The `ArduinetDeviceManager` scans for connected devices and adds them to the device list.
3. ** Device Connection**: When a device is detected, the manager creates an `ArduinetDevice` instance and establishes communication.
4. ** Bidirectional Communication**: Send commands and receive updates using `ArduinetMessage` instances, managed by the `ArduinetMessageHandler`.
5. ** Visualization and Interaction**: Use the GUI to monitor devices, view output, and send commands.

##  Extensibility

- ** Interfaces and Modular Design**: The framework uses interfaces like `IArduinetChannel` and `IArduinetDevice` to ensure modularity. This allows developers to easily add support for new communication protocols, device types, or custom functionality.
- ** Example Implementations**: Includes example integrations for various Arduino devices, demonstrating how to extend the framework.
